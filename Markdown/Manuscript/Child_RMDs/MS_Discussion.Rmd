Ethical practice is a core expectation of health researchers and computational methods underpin most quantitative research, yet an understanding of what constitutes ethical computational modelling practice in health is underdeveloped [@10.3389/fpubh.2017.00068]. The modeller responsibilities, enabling model attributes and model implementation assessment criteria that we propose can help address this gap. 

The ethical responsibilities and enabling model attributes we describe have both commonalities and distinctive features compared to a previous ethical framework for computational modelling in public health [@10.3389/fpubh.2017.00068]. The authors of that framework propose 13 questions to evaluate ethical risk across the four criteria of independence, transparency, beneficence and justice. Their descriptions of the four criteria at least partially map to either our proposed modeler responsibilities (“justice” to “social acceptability”, “independence” to “adequacy for purpose” and “beneficence” to “beneficial impact”) or enabling model attributes (“transparency”). However, while our six assessment criteria are specific to three attributes (TRU) of the computational implementation of the model, the prior ethical framework includes questions relevant to the conceptual and mathematical models and the potential impacts of model use. Examples of these more general evaluation questions include (for the justice criterion) “is any lack of knowledge about important parameters attributable to uncertainty or variability?” and (for the beneficence criterion) “if a policy is based on the model evidence, is it more likely to be effective and beneficial than a decision made in the absence of the model?”. The less numerous and more focused assessment criteria we propose may potentially be more tractable to implement in reviews of models authored by third parties and as the basis for designing software frameworks to support ethical computational model implementation.

Currently, many if not most existing CHEMs are insufficiently transparent [@Jalali2021; @McManus2019; @Bermejo2017; @Ghabri2019], reusable [@Feenstra2022; @Emerson2019] and updatable [@Sampson2017; @10.3389/fpubh.2022.899874]]. <!-- DELETION --> Existing incentive structures for health economists generally do not promote facilitating peers to reuse their work. Currently, it can take “an extraordinary amount of idealism” to commit to authoring and maintaining research software [@anzt2020environment].

Reducing waste in research is a core responsibility of research funders [@chalmers2014increase] and funding the development of CHEMs that are not adequately understood, reused or updated is wasteful. Previously recommended strategies for more beneficial health economic research investments include support for harmonized ethical standards for model development [@10.3389/fpubh.2017.00068], methodological innovation to improve model transferability  [@craig2018taking], networks of modellers working on common health conditions [@Sampson2019], and  centralized infrastructure such as open source model repositories [@Pouwels2022] and a standard platform for model implementations [@Ghabri2019]. Development of software frameworks to support ethical CHEM implementations could enable and enhance each of these strategies.

As illustrated by Table \@ref(tab:checktb), we have developed a software framework that can help us to author a youth mental health model that largely satisfy our TRU criteria. However, we believe our software framework is currently too fragile to be anything more than a prototype for supporting the development needs other modelling teams and projects. A major reason for this distinction is that our software framework was developed with the needs of only one group of developers in mind – ourselves. We currently lack the resources required to adequately implement strategies to target factors such as user enjoyment, usability, active user-community and supporting resources that influence adoption of software frameworks [@myllarniemi2018development]. 

Our prototype framework has a number of features that subsequent work to develop ethical software frameworks may find useful to incorporate. Firstly, developing a software framework to work within an existing and widely used open source programming language such as R or python, can keep framework scope relatively narrow (making it more tractable to develop, maintain and learn) while readily leveraging and coherently integrate other modelling tools written in that language (e.g. the dependency libraries we list in Table \@ref(tab:cpkgs)). Secondly, implementation that combines both object oriented and functional programming paradigms can avail of the modular and syntactical simplicity benefits of the former, while limiting needless bundling of code artefacts. Thirdly, a sensible trade-off needs to be found between transparent code implementation (which requires clear and sufficiently detailed documentation) and Agile Software Development (for which a foundational principle is prioritizing the development of working code over writing documentation [@beck2001manifesto]). Our software framework makes this trade off by enforcing the use of consistent code naming conventions and file organisation which in turn enables automated generation of simple documentation at every code update. All model data-structures and algorithms are therefore always documented (at least minimally, with machine authored content), meaning model developers have a requirement to write customized documentation less frequently.

A future software framework for ethical CHEMs would ideally incorporate a base set of features useful to developers of computational models across all domains of public health, with the capability for community-led extensions that are tailored to the needs of modellers focused on specific health-conditions.
