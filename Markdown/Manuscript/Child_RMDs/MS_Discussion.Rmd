In this article we introduced a framework that we developed to help us implement a MOSHEM in youth mental health. We outlined the standards for accountable, reusable and updatable models specified by that framework and the modelling toolkit we created to help the youth mental health MOSHEM we are developing to meet those standards. We also provided an overview of the initial set of model modules we developed with the framework to implement a utility mapping study and summarised the extent to which the outputs of that study adheres to framework standards. 

The work we have described raises a number of issues relating to the future development of a youth mental health MOSHEM, for health economists interested in undertaking other MOSHEMS and for health research funders.

## Implications for the development of a youth mental helath MOSHEM
<!-- ### Implications for our modelling team -->
Mental disorders impose high health, social and economic burdens worldwide [@RN8;@GBD2019]. Much of this burden is potentially avertable [@RN25], but poorly financed and organised mental health systems are ill-equipped for this challenge[@RN22;@RN23]. There is therefore an opportunity for economic research to help identify mental health reforms of significant potential public benefit. To date, economic studies in mental health have predominantly examined the affordability and value for money of individual programs [@RN34]. This economic evaluation work is an essential prerequisite for developing economically sustainable mental health reform plans, but it needs to be accompanied by and integrated with a broader program of economic research. The classification system developed by Wagstaff and Culyer [@wagstaff2012four] identified twelve categories of health economic research. In addition to the economic evaluation category, we have prioritised the following areas for the future development of modules for our MOSHEM:

- health and its value [utility and choice], 

- demand for health and health care, 

- determinants of health and ill-health, 

- supply of health services, 

- efficiency and equity, 

In economic evaluation, 
<!-- Yet single purpose models that assume static systems may be inadequate for the decision support needs of policymakers and service planners [@PC2020; @Occhipinti2021].  -->

<!-- The large and widespread additional mental health burdens recently observed during the COVID-19 pandemic[@20211700] and predicted as a potential future consequence of climate change [@page_howard_2010], highlight the need to improve the resilience and adaptability of these systems. To help stem growing demand for mental health services, policymakers have also been encouraged to place greater emphasis on tackling the social determinants of mental disorders [@RN11].  -->

 - Aims of our model (multi-purpose, focused on systems reform)
 - Addressing wagstaff areas ()
 - Adequacy of current methods / our capacity (errors / impact)
 - One shot at big changes
 - Opportunities for others to leverage and enhance
 - Our analysis - do it in stages, be transparent, continually improve, get help, be flexible (modelling toolkit / monolithic model), have a framework
 


 - Strengths (comparisons to existing work, benefits to ourselves and others)

 - Limitations (technical, not behavioural / institutional solution)
 
<!-- A coding framework for MOSHEMs developed in the language R includes standardised approaches to directory structure and naming conventions [@Alarid2019]. -->
<!-- Our approach to model development is to undertake a number of discrete modelling projects of the people, places, platforms and programs that shape the mental health and wellbeing of young people and to progressively link them together by means of a common framework. To model people we are developing synthetic representations of populations of interest [@DVN/HJXYKQ_2021] that describe relevant individual characteristics and their relationships, algorithms that map psychological measures to health utility [@Hamilton2021.07.07.21260129] and choice models for predicting the helpseeking behaviour of young people [@hamilton_matthew_2022_6627995]. Our in-development model of places [@DVN/V3OKZV_2022] has the aim of synthesising geometry and spatial attribute data to characterise the geographic distribution of relevant demographic, environmental, epidemiological and service infrastructure features. We are in the early stages of a multi-annual project to develop a service platform model that will represent the processes and operations of a complex primary youth mental health service. We also plan to extend and update our prior work reviewing economic evidence relating to youth mental health programs [@RN33] so that it can be integrated with this model. Our initial work on **readyforwhatsnext** is focused on Victoria, Australia but the framework we are using to develop it is designed to facilitate extension by ourselves and others to different jurisdictional decision contexts. Progress is reported on a project website [@rfwn2022]. -->
Major mental health reform programs, <!-- such as those currently being implemented in Victoria, Australia [@VicRC2021],  -->can involve the identification, prioritisation, sequencing, targeting and monitoring of multiple interdependent initiatives. 

The significant deficits in our understanding of the systems in which mental disorders emerge and are treated [@Fried2020] suggest that there is ample scope for mental health systems models to progressively improve their validity over time. Prospective work could address the weak theoretical underpinnings for understanding complex mental health systems [@RN2111]. For example, it remains unclear why increased investments in mental health care have yet to discernibly reduce the prevalence and burden of mental disorders[@RN26].  The  literature, and evidence base, regarding how the requirements, characteristics and performance of mental health services are shaped by spatiotemporal context needs to be further developed [@RN42]. There is also a need for better evidence to identify the social determinants of mental disorders most amenable to preventative interventions, and for which population sub-groups such interventions would be most effective [@RN43]. 

The development, validation and updating of more complex mental health economic models implemented over longer time frames may be too onerous a burden for a single modelling team. 
  
<!-- ### Implications for potential users of and contributors to our model -->

Another future priority is to submit production versions of each R package for review by and archiving on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) [@CRAN2022].
Developing networks of modellers working on common health conditions has been recommended as a strategy for improving model validity [@Sampson2019] and some of us are part of a nascent initiate of this type in mental health [@nmhsmn2022].

<!-- Add ref to NMHSMN in Australia --> Similarly, developing partnerships between modellers and decision-makers across the life-cycle of a modelling project can help ensure models are appropriately conceptualised, implemented and have practical utility as decision aids [@Zabell2021; @SQUIRES2016588].

## Implications for health economists
<!-- Standardized and transferable approaches to health economic modelling have been recommended. [doi:10.1017/S0266462317000666] -->
<!-- As modelling methods have become more sophisticated, some have argued that more complex models are required to adequately explore certain types of public health topics [@SQUIRES2016588].  -->
<!-- Modellers should be faithful to reaity and values of users DOI: 10.1002/asi.23697 -->

## Implications for research funders

<!-- # Motivation -->

<!-- ## Why develop OSHEMs in mental health -->





<!-- Decision makers are frequently left to rely on economic analyses that become less valid and relevant each year. A model can grow stale when changes in the real world, whether sudden (e.g. new pandemics) or gradual (e.g. demographic), is not represented by corresponding updates to relevant model features. Even when the system being modelled remains relatively stable, new research findings may potentially invalidate aspects of a model's original conceptualisation and implementation.  -->

<!-- that rarely explores complex dynamic systems  -->
<!-- [PECUNIA] -->

<!-- Computational modelling could play an important role in developing policies to improve population mental health but this may require significant changes in the way mental health modelling projects are funded, conceptualised and implemented.  -->
 <!-- but, as with health economics more generally, OSHEMs remain rare. Greater use of open source approaches could help improve the scope, validity and usefulness of mental health economic models. -->
 
<!-- Repositories such as Zenodo [@Zenodo2013] and Dataverse [@Dataverse2007] provide persistent storage solutions that generate a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for each unique item. These repositories are a preferable solution for sharing citable code and data than transitory repositories such as corporate websites or GitHub where items can be deleted or relocated at any time [@sseditors2022]. Zenodo includes tools that automate integration with GitHub, which makes it easy for developers to maintain parallel code repositories - one for disseminating the most up to date development code and the other for archiving citable code releases. --> <!-- Developers storing data in a Dataverse installation have access to multiple meta-data fields to document both a data collection and its individual constituent files.  --><!-- In R, code manuals and websites can be created with the aid of tools such as devtools [@devtools2021], sinew [@sinew2022], roxygen2 [@roxygen2021] and pkgdown [@pkgdown2022].  -->
 
<!-- and the use of version control systems. <!-- such as Git [@git20XX].  -->  
 
<!-- Applying a previously published algorithm [@kross2016] to analyse the most comprehensive archive of released R packages [@CRAN2022] finds that `r gpl_pc_dbl`% are distributed under various forms of General Public License (GPL) [@GNUGPL2022], a copyleft license. -->
<!-- In R, including a CITATION file in the `inst` directory of a package will enable users of that package to retrieve citation information by running a command of the format `citation("Package Name")` in the R console [@Salmon2021]. More generally, including a CITATION.cff file at the top level of your code repository will enable GitHub and Zenodo repositories hosting that item to include the relevant information in their citation tools [@Druskat_Citation_File_Format_2021]. Datasets hosted on Dataverse installations have metadata fields that, once completed by authors, generate citation files for dataset viewers. -->

<!-- A key challenge to generalising health economic models is that they are typically developed to inform a decision problem with a highly specific jurisdictional context. However, a number of choices about how these models are implemented can significantly increase the re-usability of model code in other contexts.  -->
<!-- For example, when generalising a model developed for the Australian context to a UK context, one could create a class that initially inherits all of the methods defined for the Australian model and then write new or replacement methods as needed for the UK model.  -->

<!-- A number of tools and approaches can make the process of implementing and curating changes to model code and data more coherent and efficient.   <!-- Repositories such as Zenodo [@Zenodo2013] and Dataverse [@Dataverse2007] provide persistent access to all published versions of a dataset, each uniquely identifiable. For code, use of version control tools like Git [@git20XX] can ensure that the entire development history of a project is organised so that each version is distinguishable and retrievable by developers. The online platform GitHub [@github2007] can make this version history accessible to anyone. -->

<!-- For R code, the usethis [@usethis2021] package can be used to partially automate version number increments using the convention Major.Minor.Patch.Development (e.g. ExampleSoftware v1.1.1.1). Datasets stored on the Harvard Dataverse use the simpler Major.Minor convention.  -->
<!-- MOSHEMs developed in R can take advantage of templates provided by devtools [@devtools2021] and pkgdown [@pkgdown2022] to run continuous integration checks on GitHub.  --><!-- These tests can include those of units (do individual functions produce expected output?), documentation (does documentation render correctly?; can all example workflows be executed?) and installation (can the software be successfully deployed on multiple types of operating system?).  -->
<!-- MH systems design is not a pharma led project - less concerns about commercial ownership -->

<!-- and for mental health specifically [@Occhipinti2021],  -->
<!-- could provide greater insight about inter-dependencies between candidate policies and the dynamic nature of the mental health systems planning context. Dynamic systems methods might provide the foundations for developing   -->
