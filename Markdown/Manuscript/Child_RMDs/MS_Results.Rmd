# Framework
<!-- Modular and open source models from other disciplines are enabled by standardisation and software.  -->
To enable us to implement ready4, we have developed a framework that:

- specifies a set of standards for MOSHEM development and use; and

- provides a modelling toolkit (repositories and software) for authoring model modules, managing data and implementing reproducible analyses consistent with those standards.
