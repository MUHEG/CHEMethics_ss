Computational models, particularly those addressing economic topics, have become essential tools for health policy development [@dakin2015influence; @Erdemir2020]. Although influential and widely used, health economic models typically have a number of limitations in accountability, reusability and updatability that at best restrict their usefulness and which in some cases may facilitate harmful misuse.

Accountability limitations of health economic models include inadequate validatation [@Ghabri2019], routinely containing errors [@Radeva2020] and, as with health policy computational models more generally, being difficult to reproduce [@Jalali2021; @McManus2019; @Bermejo2017]. Furthermore, models reflect the value judgments of their authors [potentially: https://doi.org/10.1177/0040571X221119276] relating to what questions to address, what features of a system to include, the weighting of different types of evidence and the type of stakeholders who are engaged in model design and validation [ESCAPE FROM MODEL LAND reference]. These values may at times be poorly aligned with those of the people whose lives are most impacted by decisions informed by model analyses [ESCAPE FROM MODEL LAND reference]. Some health economists have argued that more complex and sophisticated modelling methods are required to adequately explore some public health topics [@SQUIRES2016588].<!-- Systems modelling approaches have been recommended for public health economics topics [@SQUIRES2016588] but.  -->However, undertaking more ambitious models may accentuate accountability issues. More complex models may be more prone to propagation errors [@Saltelli2019]. The importance of accountability grows as models evolve from relatively simple implementations that address a single question to multipurpose tools [@Eddy2012; @Feenstra2022]. Transparency about the nature and extent of individual model authorship contributions can be harder to provide in models implemented over longer timeframes with a large team of collaborators [ESCAPE FROM MODEL LAND reference].

The resource and skills intensive task of model development can be made more tractable when modellers have the opportunity to re-use, test and refine the work of their peers [@Arnold2010]. However, as many health economic models are owned by pharmaceutical companies and consultancies, commercial considerations can limit the reuse of models and their constituent code and data[@Feenstra2022]. Many types of health data are highly sensitive with strict confidentiality requirements. For this reason, not all data included in some health economic models can be ethically made publicly available. Barriers to generalising and transferring health economic studies are often discussed in terms of study conclusions but also relate to model algorithms (can the same model logic be applied in different contexts?) and data (do shared taxonomies exist so that concepts have similar meanings in different jurisdictions?, which model parameters have values / sources that are context specific?) [Expand and add ref: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12962-021-00294-4, https://doi.org/10.1017/S026646232200321X]. 

Health economic models should be updated and refined as new evidence emerges and decision contexts change [@Jenkins2021], but this occurs infrequently [@Sampson2017]. Decision makers are frequently left to rely on economic analyses that become less valid and relevant each year. A model can grow stale when changes in the real world, whether sudden (e.g. new pandemics) or gradual (e.g. demographic), is not represented by corresponding updates to relevant model features. Even when the system being modelled remains relatively stable, new research findings may potentially invalidate aspects of a model's original conceptualisation and implementation. Funding for health economic modelling projects rarely extends to provision of medium term support for model updates and improvements. The career trajectories of health economists can also mitigate against adequate maintenance of a model, it being relatively common for model authors to have moved on from the team that owns the model IP and / or from working on the health condition for which the model was developed.

A potential strategy for improving model accountability, reusability and updatability is to make models modular and open-source.

A modular approach that ensures that model code and data are decoupled (stored in different files) can help model developers to restrict access to confidential model data, while providing open access to all other model components.
Modular approaches have been used in a small number of health economic models to link multiple self-contained components that can be independently reused and extended by other projects [@Trauer2017;@Urach2013]. Developing well validated reference models for re-used in multiple health economic modelling projects has been advocated for [@Afzali2013].

There appears to be in principle support from many health economists for greater use of open source health economic models (OSHEMs) that grant liberal permissions to access and re-use model source code and data [@Pouwels2022]. Despite the potential benefits of OSHEMs, actual implementations are rare [@Emerson2019; @Michalczyk2018; @Feenstra2022]. Barriers to adoption of OSHEMs include concerns about intellectual property, confidentiality, model misuse and the resources required to support open source implementations [@Pouwels2022; @Wu2019]. Adherence to good practice guidance is an essential requirement for healthcare modelling [@Erdemir2020], but guidelines for implementing OSHEMs remain scarce, piecemeal and need improving [@Sampson2019]. Open source is more than open access (limited discussion).

We plan to develop a modular OSHEM of youth mental health. Open source approaches have been recommended to help develop the mental health modelling field [@RN73] but only one mental health related model (in Alcohol Use Disorder [@Basu2018]) is currently indexed [RECHECK] in the Open Source Models Clearinghouse [@OSMC_20xx;@Emerson2019]. Other than our own work, we are aware of just one open source mental health reference model - in Major Depressive Disorder - that is currently in development [@IVIMDD2022].

<!-- CONTEXT: Funders should also support methodological work on context, including the development of reporting templates to facilitate accurate, comprehensive and systematic reporting of context, approaches to evidence synthesis that can capture contextual variation adequately and modelling methods that can leverage the accumulating evidence on contextual variation to predict the reach, implementation and effectiveness of promising interventions in new contexts."
