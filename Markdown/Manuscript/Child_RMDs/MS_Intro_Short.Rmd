Health economic computational models have become essential tools for health policy development [@dakin2015influence; @Erdemir2020]. Although influential and widely used, these models routinely contain errors [@Radeva2020], are rarely adequately validated [@Ghabri2019], can be difficult to reproduce [@Jalali2021; @McManus2019; @Bermejo2017] and are likely to be infrequently updated or revised [@Sampson2017]. To help address these issues, there is growing support for greater use of open source health economic models (OSHEMs) that grant liberal permissions to access and re-use model source code and data [@Pouwels2022]. However, to date, actual implementations of OSHEMs are rare [@Emerson2019; @Michalczyk2018; @Feenstra2022]. Barriers to adoption include concerns about intellectual property, confidentiality, model misuse and the resources required to support open source implementations [@Pouwels2022; @Wu2019]. As many health economic models are owned by pharmaceutical companies and consultancies, commercial considerations may also limit the uptake of OSHEMs [@Feenstra2022].

Better guidance about how to implement OSHEMs is required [@Sampson2019]. Adherence to explicit guidelines is an essential requirement for modelling in healthcare [@Erdemir2020], but current best practice recommendations for OSHEMs are scarce and piecemeal. Guidelines on health economic model transparency were published ten years ago [@Eddy2012] and made recommendations on documenting models; however, notably missing were recommendations on the sharing of model code and data. More recent and more general modelling guidance [@Erdemir2020] recommends the sharing of code and data through digital repository services such as GitHub [@github2007] and Zenodo [@Zenodo2013] and the use of version control systems such as Git [@git20XX]. A coding framework for OSHEMs developed in the language R includes standardised approaches to directory structure and naming conventions [@Alarid2019].
