Computational models, particularly those addressing economic topics, have become essential tools for health policy development [@dakin2015influence; @Erdemir2020]. Although influential and widely used, health economic models typically have a number of limitations that at best restrict their usefulness and which in some cases may facilitate harmful misuse.

There is a strong case for making health economists more accountable for the appropriate use and social acceptability of their models. Users of models should be able to assess their adequacy for a particular purpose [@thompson2019escape].  This goal is difficult to achieve in the current context of the poor reproducibility [@Jalali2021; @McManus2019; @Bermejo2017] and frequently insufficient validation [@Ghabri2019] of health economic models. Many health economic models are released with undeclared errors [@Radeva2020]. The value judgments that strongly shape health economic analyses are rarely made explicit, omissions that may lead to socially unacceptable policy recommendations [@duckett2022journey]. A modelling team's value judgments about what questions to address, the most important features of a system to represent and the weighting of different types of evidence may be poorly aligned with those of the people impacted by decisions informed by model analyses [@thompson2022escape]. As health economic models adopt more sophisticated techniques, the need for accountability grows. More complex models may be more prone to propagation errors [@Saltelli2019] and models designed to address multiple questions should be expected to meet more onerous verification and validation obligations [@Eddy2012; @Feenstra2022]. The nature and extent of individual model authorship contributions may be less clear in models implemented over longer time-frames with a large and changing group of collaborators [@thompson2022escape].

The resource and skills intensive undertaking of modelling could be made more tractable if it was easier for health economists to re-use each other's models [@Arnold2010]. However, as many health economic models are owned by pharmaceutical companies and consultancies, commercial considerations can limit the reuse of models and their constituent code and data [@Feenstra2022]. Legal and ethical issues such as privacy and confidentiality requirements further limit public release of some model artefacts [@Pouwels2022]. Transferring a health economic model developed for one jurisdiction for application in another typically involves retaining some features and updating others [@barbieri2010international]. However, models do not always make implementation choices (for example, use of concepts with standardised meanings across jurisdictions<!-- [@garcia2021cost] -->, supplying context specific data as replaceable data-packs and distributing source code under licenses that allow derivative works) that facilitate model transferability.

Health economic models should be updated and refined as new evidence emerges and decision contexts change [@Jenkins2021], but this occurs infrequently [@Sampson2017]. Funding for health economic modelling projects rarely extend to provision of medium term support for model updates and improvements. The career trajectories of health economists can also mitigate against adequate maintenance of a model, it being relatively common for model authors to have moved on from the team that owns the model and / or from working on the health condition for which the model was developed.

A potential strategy for improving model accountability, reusability and updatability is to make models both modular and open-source.

A modular model is constructed from multiple reusable and replaceable sub-models (modules) [@pan2021modular]. Modules can share inputs and outputs with other modules or can be run as independent models [@barros2023empowering]. Advantages of modular models include feasibility (large projects are broken into smaller tasks, with each component independently developed and tested) and flexibility (making it easier to selectively replace or update specific parts of a model and to scale up or down the level of granularity) [@pan2021modular]. Modular approaches are currently being used to facilitate the development of complex computational models in disciplines such as biology [@pan2021modular], neuroscience [@frazier2022robust] and ecology [@barros2023empowering]. In health economics the related and enabling concept of reference models has been recommended [@Afzali2013], but peer reviewed studies describing modular health economic models remain relatively rare, though examples exist in infectious disease [@Trauer2017] and cardiology [@Urach2013].

Modular models provide an opportunity for multiple modelling teams to contribute to, test and reuse models. To enhance this capacity, modular models may be implemented as open source projects that give others liberal permissions to access and use model source code and data [@pan2021modular; @barros2023empowering; @frazier2022robust]. Although there appears to be in principle support from many health economists for greater use of open source health economic models (OSHEMs)  [@Pouwels2022], actual implementations are rare [@Emerson2019; @Michalczyk2018; @Feenstra2022]. Barriers to adoption of OSHEMs include concerns about intellectual property, confidentiality, model misuse and the resources required to support open source implementations [@Pouwels2022; @Wu2019]. Adherence to good practice guidance is an essential requirement for healthcare modelling [@Erdemir2020], but guidelines for implementing OSHEMs remain scarce, piecemeal and need improving [@Sampson2019]. 

We plan to develop a modular OSHEM (MOSHEM) of youth mental health that is accountable, reusable and updatable. Open source approaches have been recommended to help develop the mental health modelling field [@RN73] but only one mental health related model (in Alcohol Use Disorder [@Basu2018]) is currently indexed [RECHECK] in the Open Source Models Clearinghouse [@OSMC_20xx;@Emerson2019]. We  are aware of just one other open source mental health model - a reference model in Major Depressive Disorder - that is currently in development [@IVIMDD2022].
