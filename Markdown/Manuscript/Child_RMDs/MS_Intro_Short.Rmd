Computational models have become an essential tool for healthcare policy development [@Erdemir2020]. Although influential and widely used, these models routinely contain errors [@Radeva2020], are rarely adequately validated [@Ghabri2019], can be difficult to reproduce [@Jalali2021; @McManus2019; @Bermejo2017] and are likely to be infrequently updated or revised [@Sampson2017]. To help address these issues, there is increasing in principle support for open source health economics models (OSHEMs) that grant open access to and liberal permissions to re-use model source code [@Pouwels2022]. However, in-practice implementation of OSHEMs remains rare [@Emerson2019; @Michalczyk2018; @Feenstra2022]. Barriers to adoption include concerns about intellectual property, confidentiality, model misuse and the resources required to support open source implementations [@Pouwels2022; @Wu2019]. As many health economic models are owned by pharmaceutical companies and consultancies, commercial considerations may also limit adoption of OSHEMs [@Feenstra2022].

There is also a need to develop good practice guidance for implementing OSHEMs [@Sampson2019], which is currently scarce and piecemeal. Current health economist best practice guidelines on model transparency was published ten years ago [@Eddy2012] and contained recommendations on technical and non-technical model documentation but not about how model code and data are to be shared. More recent and more general guidance recommends the sharing of model code and data using repositories such as GitHub and Zenodo as well as the use of version control systems such as Git across the development lifecycle of a modelling project [@Erdemir2020]. A coding framework for OSHEMs developed in the language R includes standardised approaches to directory structure and naming conventions[@Alarid2019].
