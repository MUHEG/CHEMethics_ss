Computational models have become essential tools for health policy development [@dakin2015influence; @Erdemir2020]. Although influential and widely used, these models routinely contain errors [@Radeva2020], are rarely adequately validated [@Ghabri2019] and can be difficult to reproduce [@Jalali2021; @McManus2019; @Bermejo2017]. To help address these issues, there is support for greater use of open source health economic models (OSHEMs) that grant liberal permissions to access and re-use model source code and data [@Pouwels2022].

Complex modelling projects may be more tractable when multiple modelling teams re-use, test and extend one another's work [@Arnold2010]. OSHEMSs might therefore mitigate some barriers to improving the longevity, quality and impact of health economic models.  For example,  health economic models should be updated and refined as new evidence emerges and decision contexts change [@Jenkins2021], but this occurs infrequently [@Sampson2017]. Reference models that can be re-used in multiple health economic modelling projects have been advocated for [@Afzali2013] but require greater investments in model transparency and validation [@Eddy2012; @Feenstra2022]. 
<!-- Systems modelling approaches have been recommended for public health economics topics [@SQUIRES2016588] but complex models may be more prone to error [@Saltelli2019].  -->

<!-- and for mental health specifically [@Occhipinti2021],  -->
<!-- could provide greater insight about inter-dependencies between candidate policies and the dynamic nature of the mental health systems planning context. Dynamic systems methods might provide the foundations for developing   -->
<!-- and models designed for multiple purposes r -->

Despite the potential benefits of OSHEMs, actual implementations  are rare [@Emerson2019; @Michalczyk2018; @Feenstra2022]. Barriers to adoption of OSHEMs include concerns about intellectual property, confidentiality, model misuse and the resources required to support open source implementations [@Pouwels2022; @Wu2019]. As many health economic models are owned by pharmaceutical companies and consultancies, commercial considerations may also limit the uptake of OSHEMs [@Feenstra2022]. Adherence to good practice guidance is an essential requirement for healthcare modelling [@Erdemir2020], but guidelines for implementing OSHEMs remain scarce, piecemeal and need improving [@Sampson2019]. 

<!-- Open source approaches have been recommended to help develop the mental health modelling field <!-- that rarely explores complex dynamic systems  -->
<!-- [@RN73] but only one mental health related model (in Alcohol Use Disorder [@Basu2018]) is indexed in the Open Source Models Clearinghouse [@OSMC_20xx;@Emerson2019]. Other than our own work, we are aware of just one open source mental health reference model - in Major Depressive Disorder - that is currently in development [@IVIMDD2022]. --> 

<!-- Mental health economic studies predominantly examine the affordability and value for money of individual programs [@RN34]. Yet single purpose models that assume static systems may be inadequate for the decision support needs of policymakers and service planners [@PC2020; @Occhipinti2021].  -->

 <!-- as part of the Open Value Initiative [@Jansen2019].  -->

<!-- Computational modelling could play an important role in developing policies to improve population mental health but this may require significant changes in the way mental health modelling projects are funded, conceptualised and implemented.  -->
 <!-- but, as with health economics more generally, OSHEMs remain rare. Greater use of open source approaches could help improve the scope, validity and usefulness of mental health economic models. -->
