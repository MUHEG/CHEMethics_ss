Health economics is a discipline concerned with problems that arise due to scarce resources, such as how to value health and healthcare, allocate healthcare budgets and configure health services [@wagstaff2012four].  In seeking to solve these problems, health economists typically use models which are simplified and selective representations of systems that are believed to influence human health. These representations can be described in words and pictures (a conceptual model), in equations (a mathematical model) or in computer code (a computational model). The predictions reported in health economic studies are typically generated by the execution of a computer program which applies a computational model to compatible data inputs (e.g., parameter values) and performs a sequence of numeric calculations.

Computational models are now widely used to inform health policy and system design [@dakin2015influence; @Erdemir2020; @LO2022100570; @Christene006827]. This level of influence has concomitant ethical responsibilities for model developers that are often poorly understood and inadequately fulfilled [@10.3389/fpubh.2017.00068; @pliakos2021ethics; @thompson2022escape; @calder2018computational]. 

Computational health economic models (CHEMs) can be implemented using specialized commercial software or authored as bespoke software projects in a programming language. Advantage of commercial modelling tools are simplicity and ease of use, but a software development approach facilitates development of models that may be more realistic, transparent, reusable and adaptable [@incerti2019r]. For CHEMs that are implemented as software projects, a major early decision is selection of an appropriate software framework. A software framework is a shared common technology used by developers to collaboratively author software and which is not typically visible to software end-users [@myllarniemi2018development]. Advantages of using software frameworks include facilitating code reuse and extension, promoting good programming practice and the capability to provide enhanced functionality and performance without additional effort by developers [@edwin2014software]. However, software frameworks can be challenging and time consuming to create [@edwin2014software] and then difficult for others to learn, often requiring developers to undergo specialist training [@myllarniemi2018development]. There is also a risk that a software framework may become excessively complex over time [@edwin2014software]. 

We are developing a model to explore multiple economic questions relating to the mental health of young people aged 12 to 25.  When making choices about how to implement this model computationally, we wished to facilitate ethical development and use. However, we are not aware of any software framework for implementing CHEMs that adhere to explicitly stated ethical requirements.
