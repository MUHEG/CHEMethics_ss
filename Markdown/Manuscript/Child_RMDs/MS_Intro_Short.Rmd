Health economics is a discipline concerned with problems that arise due to scarce resources, such as how to value health and healthcare, allocate healthcare budgets and configure health services [@wagstaff2012four].  In seeking to solve these problems, health economists typically use models which are simplified and selective representations of systems that are believed to influence human health. A health economic model should be capable of being described using three isomorphic representational approaches - words and figures (a conceptual model), equations (a mathematical model) and computer code (a computational model). Health economic scientific manuscripts typically focus on describing conceptual and mathematical model representations. However, the predictions reported in health economic studies are now almost always generated by the execution of a computer program that applies a computational model to compatible data inputs (e.g., parameter values) and performs a sequence of numeric calculations. Although health economists report strong interest in making the computational implementation of their models more transparent and accessible [@Pouwels2022], open-source model implementations remain rare [@Feenstra2022; @Emerson2019]. 

Computational health economic models (CHEMs) can be implemented using specialized commercial software or authored as software development projects in a programming language such as Python [@python2009] or R [@RCORE202]. Advantages of commercial modelling tools are simplicity and ease of use, but a software development approach may facilitate development of computational models that are more realistic, transparent, reusable and adaptable [@incerti2019r]. Which approach is most appropriate for a health economic modelling project to adopt may depend on both modelling team value judgments and the resource and time constraints within which projects need to be implemented (see Table \@ref(tab:proscons)).

For CHEMs that are implemented as software development projects, a major early decision is the selection of an appropriate software framework. A software framework is a shared common technology used by developers to collaboratively author software and which is not typically visible to software end-users [@myllarniemi2018development]. A software framework provides a foundation for developing software applications with shared resources, e.g., algorithms and data files, that can be modified to suit specific needs. Software frameworks have widely been developed and implemented in computer science, for example, PyTorch [@PyTorch2019] for machine learning using Python. 

Advantages of using software frameworks include facilitating code reuse and extension, promoting good programming practice and the capability to provide enhanced functionality and performance without additional effort by developers [@edwin2014software]. However, software frameworks can be challenging and time consuming to create [@edwin2014software] and then difficult for others to learn, often requiring model developers to undergo specialist training [@myllarniemi2018development]. There is also a risk that a software framework may become excessively complex over time [@edwin2014software].

<!-- When making choices about how to implement this health economic model computationally, we wished to facilitate ethical development and use. -->
Computational models are now widely used to inform health policy and system design [@dakin2015influence; @Erdemir2020; @LO2022100570; @Christene006827]. This level of influence has concomitant ethical responsibilities for model developers that are often poorly understood and inadequately fulfilled [@10.3389/fpubh.2017.00068; @pliakos2021ethics; @thompson2022escape; @calder2018computational]. There is limited guidance on software frameworks for implementing CHEMs that adhere to explicitly stated ethical requirements.
