Computational models have become essential tools for health policy development [@Erdemir2020]. Although influential and widely used, these models routinely contain errors [@Radeva2020], are rarely adequately validated [@Ghabri2019], can be difficult to reproduce [@Jalali2021; @McManus2019; @Bermejo2017] and are likely to be infrequently updated or revised [@Sampson2017]. To help address these issues, there is growing support for greater use of open source health economics models (OSHEMs) that grant liberal permissions to access and re-use model source code [@Pouwels2022]. However, to date actual implementations of OSHEMs are rare [@Emerson2019; @Michalczyk2018; @Feenstra2022]. Barriers to adoption include concerns about intellectual property, confidentiality, model misuse and the resources required to support open source implementations [@Pouwels2022; @Wu2019]. As many health economic models are owned by pharmaceutical companies and consultancies, commercial considerations may also limit the uptake of OSHEMs [@Feenstra2022].

There is also a need to develop good practice recommendations for OSHEMs [@Sampson2019]. Adherence to explicit standards is as essential requirement for quality health economic model implementation [@Erdemir2020], but current guidance for OSHEMs is scarce and piecemeal. Guidelines on health economic model transparency were published ten years ago [@Eddy2012] and made recommendations on documenting models but notably not on the sharing of model code and data. More recent and more general modelling guidance [@Erdemir2020] recommends the sharing of code and data through platforms such as GitHub [@github2007] and Zenodo [@Zenodo2013] and the use of version control systems such as Git [@git20XX]. A coding framework for OSHEMs developed in the language R includes standardised approaches to directory structure and naming conventions [@Alarid2019].
