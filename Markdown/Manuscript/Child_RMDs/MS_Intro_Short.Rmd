Computational models have become essential tools for health policy development [@dakin2015influence; @Erdemir2020]. Although influential and widely used, these models routinely contain errors [@Radeva2020], are rarely adequately validated [@Ghabri2019], can be difficult to reproduce [@Jalali2021; @McManus2019; @Bermejo2017] and are likely to be infrequently updated or revised [@Sampson2017]. To help address these issues, there is growing support for greater use of open source health economic models (OSHEMs) that grant liberal permissions to access and re-use model source code and data [@Pouwels2022].

Enabling multiple modelling teams to collaboratively re-use, test and extend one another's work can make complex modelling projects more tractable [@Arnold2010]. Recommendations to update and refine health economic models as new evidence emerges and decision contexts change [@Jenkins2021], adopt systems modelling approaches for public health economics topics [@SQUIRES2016588] and to develop multiple-application or reference models for re-use by different modelling teams [@Afzali2013] all involve resourcing and quality assurance challenges. For example, complex models may be more prone to error [@Saltelli2019] and reference models require greater investments in model transparency and validation [@Eddy2012; @Feenstra2022]. 

Open source approaches have been recommended to help develop a mental health modelling field that rarely explores complex dynamic systems [@RN73]. Mental health economic studies predominantly examine the affordability and value for money of individual programs [@RN34]. Yet single purpose models that assume static systems may be inadequate for the decision support needs of policymakers and service planners [@PC2020; @Occhipinti2021].

<!-- could provide greater insight about inter-dependencies between candidate policies and the dynamic nature of the mental health systems planning context. Dynamic systems methods might provide the foundations for developing   -->
<!-- and models designed for multiple purposes r -->

Despite the potential benefits, actual implementations of OSHEMs are rare [@Emerson2019; @Michalczyk2018; @Feenstra2022]. Currently there is only one mental health related model (in Alcohol Use Disorder [@Basu2018]) that is indexed in the Open Source Models Clearinghouse [@OSMC_20xx;@Emerson2019]. Other than our own work, we are aware of just one open source mental health reference model - in Major Depressive Disorder - that is currently in development [@IVIMDD2022]. Barriers to adoption of OSHEMs include concerns about intellectual property, confidentiality, model misuse and the resources required to support open source implementations [@Pouwels2022; @Wu2019]. As many health economic models are owned by pharmaceutical companies and consultancies, commercial considerations may also limit the uptake of OSHEMs [@Feenstra2022].

<!-- Computational modelling could play an important role in developing policies to improve population mental health but this may require significant changes in the way mental health modelling projects are funded, conceptualised and implemented.  -->
 <!-- but, as with health economics more generally, OSHEMs remain rare. Greater use of open source approaches could help improve the scope, validity and usefulness of mental health economic models. -->
