Computational models have become an essential tool for healthcare policy development [@Erdemir2020]. Although influential and widely used, these models routinely contain errors [@Radeva2020], are often poorly reproducible [@Jalali2021; @McManus2019] and may be infrequently updated or revised [@Sampson2017]. To address these issues, there is increasing in principle support for open source health economics models (OSHEMs) that grant open access to and liberal permission to re-use model source code [@Pouwels2022]. However, in-practice implementation of OSHEMs remains rare [@Emerson2019]. Some resistence to adoption centers on.... [@Padula2017] . 

A major shift in how health economic models are implemented.....They may also have educational value in developing the health systems modelling field [@Dunlop2017]. However, open source computational models also present a range of conceptual, technical, legal and resourcing issues compared to more traditional approaches to model development.

Over the last decade there have been
the potential to increase the transparency, reproducibility and reuse of health economic analyses. 

Open source frameworks, which have been recommended for the development of mental health modelling field [@RN73], have the potential to help address a number of these challenges. Open source approaches can promote common standards and interoperability, improve model transparency and facilitate routine updates to rectify errors, update data and add features.  

- Our project - readyforwhatsnext : open source model of the systems shaping the mental health of young people
- Lack of guidance on open source health economic models and in particular on recommended frameworks for implementing the computational model.
- Focus computational model. Most in need of novel guidance. Also: Of the three components that comprise a mental health computer simulation model - the conceptual model, the mathematical model and the computational model - only the first two are typically developed and reported in a manner that facilitates reuse, refinement and extension by others. This is problematic as the code implementation is where the theory represented by a simulation model is most fully elaborated.
