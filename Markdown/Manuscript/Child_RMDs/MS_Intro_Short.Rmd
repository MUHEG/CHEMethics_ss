Computational models, particularly those addressing economic topics, have become essential tools for health policy development [@dakin2015influence; @Erdemir2020]. Although influential and widely used, health economic models typically have a number of limitations that at best restrict their usefulness and which in some cases may facilitate harmful misuse.

There is a strong case for making health economists more accountable for the appropriate use and social acceptability of their models. Users of models should be able to assess their adequacy for a particular purpose [@thompson2019escape].  This goal is difficult to achieve in the current context of the poor reproducibility [@Jalali2021; @McManus2019; @Bermejo2017] and frequently insufficient validation [@Ghabri2019] of health economic models. Many health economic models are released with undeclared errors [@Radeva2020]. The value judgments that strongly shape health economic analyses are rarely made explicit, omissions that may lead to socially unacceptable policy recommendations [@duckett2022journey]. A modelling team's value judgments about what questions to address, the most important features of a system to represent and the weighting of different types of evidence may be poorly aligned with those of the people impacted by decisions informed by model analyses [@thompson2022escape]. As health economic models adopt more sophisticated techniques, the need for accountability grows. More complex models may be more prone to propagation errors [@Saltelli2019] and models designed to address multiple questions should be expected to meet more onerous verification and validation obligations [@Eddy2012; @Feenstra2022]. The nature and extent of individual model authorship contributions may be less clear in models implemented over longer time-frames with a large and changing group of collaborators [@thompson2022escape].

The resource and skills intensive undertaking of modelling could be made more tractable if it was easier for health economists to re-use each other's models [@Arnold2010]. However, as many health economic models are owned by pharmaceutical companies and consultancies, commercial considerations can limit the reuse of models and their constituent code and data [@Feenstra2022]. Legal and ethical issues such as privacy and confidentiality requirements further limit public release of some model artefacts [@Pouwels2022]. Transferring a health economic model developed for one jurisdiction for application in another typically involves retaining some features and updating others [@barbieri2010international]. However, models do not always make implementation choices (for example, use of concepts with standardised meanings across jurisdictions<!-- [@garcia2021cost] -->, supplying context specific data as replaceable data-packs and distributing source code under licenses that allow derivative works) that facilitate model transferability.

Health economic models should be updated and refined as new evidence emerges and decision contexts change [@Jenkins2021], but this occurs infrequently [@Sampson2017]. Funding for health economic modelling projects rarely extend to provision of medium term support for model updates and improvements. The career trajectories of health economists can also mitigate against adequate maintenance of a model, it being relatively common for model authors to have moved on from the team that owns the model and / or from working on the health condition for which the model was developed.

A potential strategy for improving model accountability, reusability and updatability is to make models both modular and open-source.

A modular model is constructed from multiple reusable and replaceable sub-models (modules) [@pan2021modular]. Modules can share inputs and outputs with other modules or can be run as independent models [@barros2023empowering]. Advantages of modular models include feasibility (large projects are broken into smaller tasks, with each component independently developed and tested) and flexibility (making it easier to selectively replace or update specific parts of a model and to scale up or down the level of granularity) [@pan2021modular]. Modular approaches are currently being used to facilitate the development of complex computational models in disciplines such as biology [@pan2021modular], neuroscience [@frazier2022robust] and ecology [@barros2023empowering]. In health economics the related and enabling concept of reference models has been recommended [@Afzali2013], but peer reviewed studies describing modular health economic models remain relatively rare, though examples exist in infectious disease [@Trauer2017] and cardiology [@Urach2013].

Modular models provide an opportunity for multiple modelling teams to contribute to, test and reuse models. To enhance this capacity, modular models may be implemented as open source projects that give others liberal permissions to access and use model source code and data [@pan2021modular; @barros2023empowering; @frazier2022robust]. Although there appears to be in principle support from many health economists for greater use of open source health economic models (OSHEMs)  [@Pouwels2022], actual implementations are rare [@Emerson2019; @Michalczyk2018; @Feenstra2022]. Barriers to adoption of OSHEMs include concerns about intellectual property, confidentiality, model misuse and the resources required to support open source implementations [@Pouwels2022; @Wu2019]. Adherence to good practice guidance is an essential requirement for healthcare modelling [@Erdemir2020], but guidelines for implementing OSHEMs remain scarce, piecemeal and need improving [@Sampson2019]. 

Our interest in modular and open source source approaches developed when we began seeking am appropriate framework for undertaking and validly synthesising diverse types of economic research in mental health. Mental disorders impose high health, social and economic burdens worldwide [@RN8;@GBD2019]. Much of this burden is potentially avertable [@RN25], but poorly financed and organised mental health systems are ill-equipped for this challenge [@RN22;@RN23]. A substantial economic literature already exists to assess the affordability and value for money of mental health interventions [@RN34]. This economic evaluation work is an essential prerequisite for improving allocative efficiency in mental health, but could be of greater value to systems planners if integrated with a broader program of economic research. 

We are developing ready4 (https://www.ready4-dev.com), a modular OSHEM (MOSHEM) on the mental health of young people aged 12 to 25. We are initially applying ready4 to four of the twelve domains of health economics identified by Wagstaff and Culyer [@wagstaff2012four]:
<!-- There is therefore an opportunity for health economists to undertake mental health research of significant potential public benefit. -->

- *health and its value* (our projects: utility mapping models); 

- *determinants of health and ill-health* (our projects: models for creating rich and representative synthetic household populations from survey data);

- *demand for health and health care* (our projects: spatial epidemiology and help-seeking choice models); and

- *supply of health services* (our projects: a model of primary mental health care services). 

Once these projects are completed, our aim is to flexibly combine these models to answer questions in two additional Wagstaff and Culyer domains:

- *efficiency and equity* (our goal: assess the distributional impacts and identify the optimal targeting of care provision); and

- *economic evaluation* (our goal: assess the cost-utility of competing policy options).

To undertake this work we first needed to develop a framework for standardisation. Standardisation is an essential enabler of automation, collaboration, interoperability and transferability in modular and open source approaches. However, MOSHEMs remain rare and is unclear what standards are most appropriate to specify. A MOSHEMs is a computational modelling project, so standards developed for ready4 will need to be verified and implemented by software, some of which will need to be developed for this specific purpose. 

<!-- When planning how to undertake and synthesise this program of work, we became concerned with issues relating to accountability, reusability and updatability. If mistakes are common in individual health economic modelling projects [@Radeva2020], then combining multiple projects may be particularly error prone. The risk of errors may also depend on whether a model is too simple or too complex [@Saltelli2019], so the level of granularity appropriate for one model application may be ill-suited to another. Undertaking a multiannual program of interdependent work raises the risk that models developed in the first phase of a project may need to be updated by the time the project is approaching conclusion. -->

<!-- These concerns led us to seek the MOSHEM approach that provides the transparency to make it easier for errors to be uncovered, the adaptability to fix these errors and the flexibility to facilitate interchangeability between representations of different levels of granularity.  -->
