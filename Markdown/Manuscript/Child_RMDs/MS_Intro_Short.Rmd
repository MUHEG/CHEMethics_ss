Health economic computational models have become essential tools for health policy development [@dakin2015influence; @Erdemir2020]. Although influential and widely used, these models routinely contain errors [@Radeva2020], are rarely adequately validated [@Ghabri2019], can be difficult to reproduce [@Jalali2021; @McManus2019; @Bermejo2017] and are likely to be infrequently updated or revised [@Sampson2017]. To help address these issues, there is growing support for greater use of open source health economic models (OSHEMs) that grant liberal permissions to access and re-use model source code and data [@Pouwels2022].

Collaborations across multiple modelling teams that include the ability to re-use and extend one another's work can make complex modelling projects more tractable [@Arnold2010]. Reference models intended for multiple-applications and re-use by different modelling teams have been advocated for [@Afzali2013] but require greater investments in model transparency and validation [@Eddy2012; @Feenstra2022]. Systems modelling approaches may be particularly relevant to exploring some public health economics topics  [@SQUIRES2016588] but such complex models may be more prone to error [@Saltelli2019]. To retain and improve their utility as decision aids, health economic models require updating and refinement as new evidence emerges and decision contexts change [@Jenkins2021].

Open source approaches have been recommended to help develop a mental health field that rarely models complex dynamic systems [@RN73]. Economic studies predominantly examining the affordability and value for money of individual mental health programs [@RN34]. Yet such single purpose models that assume static systems may be inadequate for the decision support needs of policymakers and service planners [@PC2020; @Occhipinti2021].

<!-- could provide greater insight about inter-dependencies between candidate policies and the dynamic nature of the mental health systems planning context. Dynamic systems methods might provide the foundations for developing   -->
<!-- and models designed for multiple purposes r -->

Despite the potential benefits, actual implementations of OSHEMs are rare [@Emerson2019; @Michalczyk2018; @Feenstra2022]. Currently there is only one mental health related model (in Alcohol Use Disorder [@Basu2018]) that is indexed in the Open Source Models Clearinghouse [@OSMC_20xx;@Emerson2019]. Other than our own work, we are aware of just one open source mental health reference model - in Major Depressive Disorder - that is currently in development [@IVIMDD2022]. Barriers to adoption of OSHEMs include concerns about intellectual property, confidentiality, model misuse and the resources required to support open source implementations [@Pouwels2022; @Wu2019]. As many health economic models are owned by pharmaceutical companies and consultancies, commercial considerations may also limit the uptake of OSHEMs [@Feenstra2022].

<!-- Computational modelling could play an important role in developing policies to improve population mental health but this may require significant changes in the way mental health modelling projects are funded, conceptualised and implemented.  -->
 <!-- but, as with health economics more generally, OSHEMs remain rare. Greater use of open source approaches could help improve the scope, validity and usefulness of mental health economic models. -->
