We applied the ready4 framework to develop an initial set of MOSHEM modules, supplying those modules with data and implementing analyses. These tools were created as part of a previously described study [@Hamilton2021.07.07.21260129] to develop utility mapping models appropriate for use in samples of young people presenting to primary mental health services. The ready4 framework's modelling toolkit created the following artefacts:

 - development version module libraries for describing and validating youth mental health human record datasets [@hamilton_matthew_2022_6084467], scoring health utility [@hamilton_matthew_2022_6084824], specifying utility mapping models [@hamilton_matthew_2022_6116701] and implementing reproducible utility mapping studies [@gao_caroline_2022_6130155];
 
 - a development version library of functions for finding and using utility mapping models developed with these tools [@matthew_p_hamilton_2021_5646669];
 
 - data collections of synthetic populations for testing model modules [@DVN/HJXYKQ_2021] and study input and results data [@DVN/DKDIB0_2021]; 
 
 - programs for replicating all steps from data ingest to manuscript reporting [@hamilton_matthew_2022_6129906], applying utility mapping models to new data [@hamilton_matthew_2022_6416330] and generating a synthetic representation of the study dataset [@hamilton_matthew_p_2022_6321821];
 
 - subroutines for creating a catalogue of utility mapping models [@hamilton_matthew_2022_6116385] and generating a draft scientific manuscript [@matthew_p_hamilton_2022_5976988] for studies implemented with these modules.
 
We assess that these study outputs either wholly or mostly meet 18 out of 20 framework standards(see Table \@ref(tab:checktb)). The two standards where the study outputs currently fall short are in reporting code coverage and including a user-interface. Both these items are scheduled to be addressed when we release production versions of the code libraries.
