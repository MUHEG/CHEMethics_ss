## readyforwhatsnext
Our approach to model development is to undertake a number of discrete modelling projects of the people, places, platforms and programs that shape the mental health and wellbeing of young people and to progressively link them together by means of a common framework. To model people we are developing synthetic representations of populations of interest [@DVN/HJXYKQ_2021] that describe relevant individual characteristics and their relationships, algorithms that map psychological measures to health utility [@Hamilton2021.07.07.21260129] and choice models for predicting the helpseeking behaviour of young people [@hamilton_matthew_2022_6627995]. Our in-development model of places [@DVN/V3OKZV_2022] has the aim of synthesising geometry and spatial attribute data to characterise the geographic distribution of relevant demographic, environmental, epidemiological and service infrastructure features. We are in the early stages of a multi-annual project to develop a service platform model that will represent the processes and operations of a complex primary youth mental health service. We also plan to extend and update our prior work reviewing economic evidence relating to youth mental health programs [@RN33] so that it can be integrated with this model.

Our initial work on **readyforwhatsnext** is focused on Victoria, Australia but the framework we are using to develop it is designed to facilitate extension by ourselves and others to different jurisdictional decision contexts. Progress is reported on a project website [@rfwn2022].

## Utility mapping

We used framework toolkits to develop model code and datasets for implementing a utility mapping study that has previously been described [@Hamilton2021.07.07.21260129]. Table \@ref(tab:checktb) assesses that study against each TIMELY standard, 18 of which the study was able to meet. The two current standards where the study falls short are in reporting code coverage and including a user-interface. Both these items are current development priorities for our team.
