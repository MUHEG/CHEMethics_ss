<!-- Add aims text here -->
We are currently developing **readyforwhatsnext**, a reference OSHEM that aims to examine multiple potential population level strategies for promoting mental wellbeing and preventing and treating mental disorders in young people. <!-- We have consolidated and refined these and other recommended guidelines for OSHEMs as part of a framework for developing an open source model of youth mental health.  -->In this paper, we describe:

- a proposed set of guidelines for quality implementation of OSHEMS;
- a framework for standardised and reproducible application of these guidelines to the development of the  **readyforwhatsnext** model; 
- a worked example of the first **readyforwhatsnext** model component developed using the framework.
