In this paper, we introduce a framework for developing a modular youth mental health OSHEM. Specifically we describe the framework's:

- good practice standards for implementing a modular OSHEM;

- software toolkit for developing a modular OSHEM consistent with those good practice standards; and

- application to implementing model modules to support the development and use of utility mapping models.

<!-- We have consolidated and refined these and other recommended guidelines for OSHEMs as part of a framework for developing an open source model of youth mental health.  -->
