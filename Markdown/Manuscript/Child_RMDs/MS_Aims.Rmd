In this paper, we describe:

(i) the ready4 framework, that is comprised of:
  - a set of standards for implementing an accountable, reusable and updatable MOSHEM; and
  - a modelling toolkit (online repositories and software) for applying those standards to the authoring of MOSHEM modules, datasets and analyses; and

(ii) how we used the ready4 framework to develop and apply modules for utility mapping.
