In this paper, we describe:
(i)	a set of ethical responsibilities for CHEM developers and criteria for assessing responsible CHEM implementations;
(ii)	a prototype software framework for the ethical implementation of CHEMs; and
(iii)	use of the software framework to develop a computational economic model in youth mental health, with an initial focus on outcome valuation.
