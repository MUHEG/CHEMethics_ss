<!-- Add aims text here -->
In this paper, we describe:

- a proposed set of guidelines for implementing OSHEMS;
- a framework for applying these guidelines to the development of a reference OSHEM in youth mental health; 
- a worked example of a modelling project developed with the framework.

<!-- We are currently developing **readyforwhatsnext**, a reference OSHEM that aims to examine multiple potential population level strategies for promoting mental wellbeing and preventing and treating mental disorders in young people. -->
<!-- We have consolidated and refined these and other recommended guidelines for OSHEMs as part of a framework for developing an open source model of youth mental health.  -->
