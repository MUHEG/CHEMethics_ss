In this paper, we describe:

(i)	proposed criteria for assessing ethical CHEM implementations;

(ii) a prototype software framework for the ethical implementation of CHEMs; and

(iii)	how the software framework is being used to develop an open-source CHEM in youth mental health, with an initial focus on valuing health outcomes.
