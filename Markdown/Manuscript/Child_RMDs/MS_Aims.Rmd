In this paper, we introduce a framework for developing youth mental health OSHEMs. Specifically we describe:

- a set of guidelines for implementing OSHEMs;

- a toolkit for applying these guidelines in youth mental health; and

- a worked example of a modelling project developed with the toolkit.

<!-- We have consolidated and refined these and other recommended guidelines for OSHEMs as part of a framework for developing an open source model of youth mental health.  -->
