We have consolidated and refined these and other recommended standards for OSHEMs and developed tools to help implement them as part of a framework for developing an open source model of youth mental health. In this paper, we describe our motivation for developing the framework, the rationale for each standard specified in the framework, the toolkits we have developed and a worked example of a modelling project developed with the framework.
