In this paper, we introduce a framework for developing a modular youth mental health MOSHEM. Specifically we:

(i) describe a framework that is comprised of:
  - a set of standards for implementing a MOSHEM; and
  - a modelling toolkit (repositories and software) to author MOSHEM modules, supply them with data and undertake reproducible analyses consistent with those standards.

(ii) provide a worked example of how we used the framework to develop and apply MOSHEM modules for utility mapping.
