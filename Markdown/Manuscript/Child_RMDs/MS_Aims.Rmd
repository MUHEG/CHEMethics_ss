In this paper, we:

(i)	propose a set of ethical responsibilities for CHEM developers and funders and criteria for assessing ethical CHEM implementations;

(ii) describe a prototype software framework we have developed to support the ethical implementation of CHEMs; and

(iii)	assess an initial set of youth mental health CHEMs developed with our software framework against our proposed ethical CHEM implementation criteria.
