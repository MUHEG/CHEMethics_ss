In this paper, we:

(i) describe a framework comprised of:
  - a set of standards for implementing an accountable, reusable and updatable MOSHEM; and
  - a modelling toolkit (online repositories and software) for applying those standards to the authoring of ready4 modules, datasets and analyses; and

(ii) provide a worked example of how we used the framework to develop and apply ready4 modules for utility mapping.
