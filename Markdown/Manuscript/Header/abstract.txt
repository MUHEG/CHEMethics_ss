\\textbf{Summary: }
Despite growing support for open source health economic models (OSHEMs), uptake remains limited and better guidance about how to implement them is required. One potential benefit of high quality OSHEMS is the development of more valid, useful and extensive models to inform the design of population mental health strategies. In this article we describe a framework we have developed for an OSHEM in youth mental health. The framework includes a set of 20 good practice standards and toolkits for developing models that meet those standards. Framework standards are intended to support the development of OSHEMS that are TIMELY - Transparent (6 standards), Iterative (4 standards), Modular (2 standards), Epitomised (3 standards) and Yielding (2 standards). Framework toolkits include repositories for development version code, archived code and model data as well as six novel R packages. Framework software provides a modelling syntax, template modules and tools for authoring model modules, functions, code libraries, datasets and reports. We discuss the rationale for each standard included in our framework and provide a worked example of the application of the framework to implement a utility mapping study.
