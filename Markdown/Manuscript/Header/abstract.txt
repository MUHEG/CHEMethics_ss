\\textbf{Background: }
Open source approaches have the scope to improve the transparency, quality and decision utility of health economic models of mental health systems. 
\\newline
\\newline
\\textbf{Objectives: }
We aimed to develop a conceptual and technical framework for implementing open source mental health systems models and illustrate how it can be applicatied to economic topics in youth mental health.
\\newline
\\newline
\\textbf{Methods: }
We created a software development kit in R to support standardised implementation of mental health systems models. As a worked example, we applied the toolkit to develop open source youth mental health utility mapping models, which we assessed against five principles using 17 standards.
\\newline
\\newline
\\textbf{Results: }
Six R packages and a coding style dataset provide a toolkit for implementing mental health models that are TIMELY - Transparent, Iterative, Modular, Epitomised, Licensed and Yielding. The utility mapping models we developed with this toolkit fully met X and partially met Y TIMELY standards.
