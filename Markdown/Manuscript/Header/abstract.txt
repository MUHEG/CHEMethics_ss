\\textbf{Summary: }
Despite growing support for open source health economic models (OSHEMs), uptake remains limited. 
                                             The deployment of modular approaches to model development is also relatively underdeveloped compared to other disciplines.
                                             In this article, we propose a framework for developing a modular OSHEM in youth mental health and describe our preliminary efforts to apply this framework to develop youth specific utility mapping models.
                                             The framework includes a set of X1 good practice standards and software for implementing a model that is accountable (X2 standards), reusable (X3 standards) and upatable (X4 standards). 
                                             We provide a rationale for each standard.
                                             The framework also includes a software toolkit comprised of six novel R packages for authoring models, supplying those models with data and using those models to implement reproducible analyses. 
                                             We describe an early application of this toolkit to developing utility mapping models that meet X5 framework standards. 
                                             We discuss the potential benefits and challenges of extending this initial work to develop a more extensive model for undertaking economic evaluations in youth mental health.
