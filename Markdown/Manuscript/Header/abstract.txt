\\textbf{Summary: }
Most health economic analyses are undertaken with the aid of computers. However, the ethical dimensions of implementing health economic models as software are poorly understood. 
                                                        We propose that the core ethical responsibilities of model developers and funders over a health economic software development lifecycle are to (i) make socially acceptable system requirements and design decisions; (ii) ensure fit for purpose implementation; and (iii) support socially beneficial use. 
                                                        We further propose that a transparent (T), reusable (R) and updatable (U) computational health economic model (CHEM) is suggestive of a project team that has largely fulfilled these responsibilities.
                                                        We propose six TRU criteria for assessing CHEMs: (T1) software files are open access; (T2) developer judgments and contributions are easily identified; 
                                                        (R1) programming practices promote generalisability and transferability; (R2) terms of use restrict only unethical applications; (U1) maintenance infrastructure is in place; and 
                                                        (U2) new releases are systematically retested and appropriately deprecated.
                                                        To facilitate CHEMs that meet TRU criteria, we have developed a prototype software framework in the programming language R.
                                                        The framework comprises six code libraries for authoring CHEMs, supplying CHEMs with data and using CHEMs to undertake analyses. 
                                                        The framework integrates with existing services for software development and research data archiving. 
                                                        We determine that an initial set of youth mental health CHEMs we developed with the framework wholly meet criteria T1-2, R1-2 and U1 and partially meet criterion U2.
                                                        Our assessment criteria and software framework can help inform and improve ethical implementation of future health economic software projects.
