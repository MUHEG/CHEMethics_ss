\\textbf{Summary: }
There is strong in principle support for open source health economic models, but practical barriers limit their availability. We propose a set of principles and standards for the implementation of open source health economic models that are TIMELY - Transparent, Iterative, Modular, Epitomised and Yielding. We then describe a software framework that we have developed for developing TIMELY models in youth mental health and illustrate this framework with an open source utility mapping project.
