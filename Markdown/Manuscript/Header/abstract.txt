\\textbf{Summary: }
Compared to other disciplines, health economics rarely uses modular approaches to model development that facilitate re-use of model components. 
                                             Although interest in open source health economic models (OSHEMs) is growing, uptake remains limited.
                                             We propose a framework for a modular OSHEM in youth mental health.
                                             The framework includes of set of X1 good practice standards for implementing a model that is accountable (X2 standards), reusable (X3 standards) and upatable (X4 standards). 
                                             We provide a rationale for each standard.
                                             The framework also includes software toolkit of six R packages for authoring model modules (data structures and algorithms), supplying those modules with data and using the modules to implement reproducible modelling analyses. 
                                             We describe an early application of the framework to developing utility mapping models that meet X5 standards. 
                                             We discuss the potential benefits and challenges of extending this initial work to develop a more extensive model for undertaking economic analyses in youth mental health.
