\\textbf{Summary: }
Health economists make limited use of the modular and open source approaches that other disciplines use for collaborative development of complex models. 
                                             We propose a framework for developing a modular open source health economic model (MOSHEM) in youth mental health called ready4.
                                             The framework includes of set of 20 standards for implementing a MOSHEM that is accountable (seven standards), reusable (nine standards) and updatable (four standards). 
                                             We provide a rationale for each standard.
                                             The framework also includes a modelling toolkit of open access repositories and six R libraries for authoring MOSHEM modules, supplying those modules with data and implementing reproducible modelling analyses. 
                                             We describe an early application of the framework to implementing a utility mapping study and detail how the MOSHEM components produced by that study meet 18 framework standards. 
                                             We discuss how the framework will enable us to undertake and synthesise diverse economic modelling studies in youth mental health and highlight some broader implications for undertaking MOSHEMs to explore mental health and other topics.
