\\textbf{Summary: }
The ethical dimensions of implementing health economic models as software projects are poorly understood. 
                                                        We propose that the core responsibilities of computational health economic model (CHEM) developers over a project lifecycle are to (i) make socially acceptable design decisions; (ii) ensure fit for purpose development; and (iii) support socially beneficial use. 
                                                        We further propose that a transparent, reusabile and updatable CHEM is suggestive of a modelling team that has largely fulfilled these responsibilities.
                                                        We propose six criteria for assesing the transparency (T), reusability (R) and updatability (U) of CHEMs: (T1) software files are published in open access repositories; (T2) it is easy to identify the underpinning judgments and individual contributions of CHEM developers; 
                                                        (R1) programming practices that promote generalisability and transferability have been used; (R2) open source licenses have been used; (U1) model maintenance infrastructure is in place; and 
                                                        (U2) new CHEM versions are systematically retested and appropriately deprecated.
                                                        To facilitate CHEMs that meet TRU criteria, we have developed a prototype software framework in the programming language R.
                                                        The framework comprises six code libraries for authoring CHEMs, supplying CHEMs with data and using CHEMs to undertake analyses. 
                                                        The framework supports integrations with existing digital services for collaborative software development and research data archiving. 
                                                        We are applying the framework to model youth mental health systems and determine that our initial CHEMs wholly meet criteria T1-2, R1-2 and U1 and partially meet criterion U2.
                                                        Our assessment criteria and software framework can help inform and improve ethical implementation of future health economic software projects.
