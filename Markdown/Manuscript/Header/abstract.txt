\\textbf{Summary: }
Computers are tools that are now essential to the work of health economists. 
                                             However, the ethical dimensions of how health economic models are implemented computationally are poorly understood. 
                                             Explicit ethical standards for computational health economic models (CHEMs) amd the technical infrastructure to facilitate implementations of that meet those standards are required. 
                                             We propose six criteria for assessing ethical implementation of CHEMs â€“ two each for the three domains of transparency, reusability and updatability. 
                                             To facilitate the implementation of CHEMs that meet these criteria, we developed a novel prototype software framework in the open source programming language R. 
                                             The framework comprises six code libraries that collectively provide a toolkit for authoring CHEMs, supplying them with data and using them to undertake generalisable and transferable analyses.  
                                             The framework supports integrations with existing digital services for collaborative software development and data archiving. We are currently applying the software framework to develop and apply utility mapping models in youth mental health. 
                                             We assess the first set of utility mapping CHEMs that we have developed with the framework as wholly meeting both transparency criteria (open access code and data and clarity about author contributions and beliefs), one reusability criteria (liberal terms of use) and one updatability criteria (infrastructure for model maintenance) and partially meeting the two remaining criteria for transparency (supports generalisability and transferability) and updatability (retesting and deprecation).  
                                             The assessment criteria and the software framework we have developed can inform future work to understand and improve ethical computational implementations of health economic models.
