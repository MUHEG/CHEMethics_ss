\\textbf{Summary: }
Most health economic analyses are undertaken with the aid of computers. However, the research ethics of implementing health economic models as software (or computational health economic models (CHEMs)) are poorly understood. 
                                                        We propose that developers and funders of CHEMs should adhere to research ethics principles and pursue the goals of: (i) socially acceptable user requirements and design specifications; (ii) fit for purpose implementations; and (iii) socially beneficial post-release use. 
                                                        We further propose that a transparent (T), reusable (R) and updatable (U) CHEM is suggestive of a project team that has largely met these goals.
                                                        We propose six criteria for assessing TRU CHEMs: (T1) software files are open access; (T2) developer contributions and judgments on appropriate use are easily identified; 
                                                        (R1) programming practices promote selective reuse; (R2) licenses permit reuse and derivative works; (U1) maintenance infrastructure is in place; and 
                                                        (U2) releases are systematically retested and deprecated.
                                                        Few existing CHEMs would meet all TRU criteria. Addressing these limitations will require changes to the work practices, funding and tools that underpin health economic model development.
                                                        Priority actions include the development of new and updated good practice guidelines and research infrastructure and human capital investments.
