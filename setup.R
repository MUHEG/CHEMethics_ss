One potential benefit of high quality OSHEMS is the development of more valid, useful and extensive models to inform the design of population mental health strategies. 
                                             In this article, we describe a framework that we have developed for an OSHEM in youth mental health. 
                                             The framework includes a set of 20 good practice standards and toolkits for developing models that meet those standards. 
                                             Framework standards are intended to support the development of OSHEMS that are TIMELY - Transparent (6 standards), Iterative (4 standards), Modular (2 standards), Epitomising (3 standards), Licensed (3 standards) and Yielding (2 standards). 
                                             Framework toolkits include repositories for model data and code as well as six novel R packages. The R packages provide a novel syntax, template modules and modelling tools for authoring model modules, function libraries, datasets and reports. 
                                             We discuss the rationale for each standard included in our framework and provide a worked example of the application of the framework to implement a utility mapping study. ",
