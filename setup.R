                                             We propose a framework for developing a modular open source health economic model (MOSHEM) in youth mental health called ready4.
                                             The framework includes of set of 20 standards for implementing a MOSHEM that is accountable (seven standards), reusable (nine standards) and updatable (four standards). 
                                             We provide a rationale for each standard.
                                             The framework also includes a modelling toolkit of open access repositories and six R libraries for authoring ready4 modules (data structures and algorithms), supplying those modules with data and using the modules to implement reproducible modelling analyses. 
                                             We describe an early application of the framework to developing utility mapping models that currently meet 18 framework standards. 
                                             We discuss the potential benefits and challenges of extending ready4 in order to undertake and synthesise diverse economic modelling studies in youth mental health and highlight some broader implications for health economists and research funders.",
