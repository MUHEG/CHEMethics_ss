                                             We propose criteria for assessing the ethical implementation of computational health economic models (CHEMs), describe a novel prototype software framework for developing CHEMs that meet these criteria and outline how we are using this software framework to develop and synthesise multiple economic models in youth mental health. 
                                             We propose a total of six assessment criteria – two each for enabling transparent, reusable and updatable (TRU) CHEMs. 
                                             The software framework is comprised of six R libraries that provide a toolkit for authoring CHEMs, supplying CHEMs with data and using CHEMs to implementing reproducible modelling analyses. 
                                             The framework libraries integrate with existing online services for collaborative software development and data archiving. One of the initial applications of the software framework was to develop and apply utility mapping models in youth mental health. 
                                             We assess the utility mapping CHEM as wholly meeting four of our ethical assessment criteria and partially meeting the remaining two criteria. 
                                             We discuss how the ethical assessment criteria we have identified and the software framework we have developed can inform future work to develop understanding and implementation of ethical computational modelling practice in health economics.",
